# AMATH563 Final Project
## Modeling the Ferromagnetic Transition of the 2D Ising Model Using PDE-Find
### Morgan Masters, Ryan Vogt

In this project: 
[x] Synthetic data was generated at evenly-spaced temperatures across [0, 5] Kelvin ([-273.15, -268.15] degrees Celcius) interval.
    - Simulate thermodynamic equilibration of random initial state at each temperatuire via a Monte Carlo method to capture probabilistic behavior.
